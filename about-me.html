    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My favorite childhood memory is when I went to Singapore. I loved everything in singapore. I still remember that the sea lion looking statue looked so elegant. My favorite part of the trip was going to universal studios. The transformers ride had the longest line ever, so my little brother got lost becuase he went to the very front. He found him crying at the very front when we were searching for him. We were really scared at the time, but it was pretty funny. Now, my brother never wanders off by himself, not even at the mall. All of the rides were very fun, and I love going on rollercoaster, so it was an amazing vacation.</p>
